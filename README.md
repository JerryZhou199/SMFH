This package contains cleaned up codes for the IJCAI paper, including: <br />
SMFH.m: function to compute the hash code and hash function <br />
normalize1.m: function to normalize the feature points <br />
testWiki.m: example script to run the code on the Wiki dataset <br />

p.s. The parameters \mu and \alpha should be set to 100 and 10 to achieve well performance, when the feature dimensional is high.
